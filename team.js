var test_phrase = "Hello World"

console.log(test_phrase)

// var beginning = Time()

var input = prompt("Type that as fast as you can")
// Here the coder assumes that the code after prompt will not execute until the user has hit enter on the prompt.

// var end = Time()

// compare test_phrase to input and return accuracy
//return accuracy
console.log("Your score was " + accuracy)
